System calls 

Allows you to call functions that the system has
These technques will differ depending on what os one is using.

Fork

When you load a program into memory you have a process
you can have multiple process for one program
Fork creates another process using the same executable. 
parent process and child process.
Identical copy of the parent process 
In the child processs the value of fork is 0.
In the parent processs the value of fork is the Process ID (pid) of the new process

In the second example the child process will do its stuff and the stuff of the parent which might be more problamatic. 

System calls can fail. If fork fails it returns -1 as an error code. 

Linux has something called errorno which keeps the last error from the last system call. 

In example 3 there is a wait call that waits for the child process to die.
