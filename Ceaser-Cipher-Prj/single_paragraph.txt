In chapter 2 of Captives as Commodities, the focus shifted away from what 
and why the Europeans were taking slaves from Africa and focused on Africa 
itself and its motivations for selling slaves. What was the cultural 
situation in Africa that made its people sell other Africans? 
This question should have observations about the culture of 
power within African societies. Itâ€™s important to ask this 
question because it makes us understand the people of Africa 
during this time period. It gets us to see the other side of 
the slave trade that is often overlooked.
